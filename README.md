# ML_centriole_pipeline
This github contains the pipeline to detect centrioles and nuclei in fluorescence images and proceed to associate them

### Repo organization :



## Part A : Centriole detection 

#### Required libraries for this part

### Libraries :
#### numpy		-> basic python library, mainly used for array manipulation
#### os		-> make paths to files
#### pandas		-> read and create dataframe
#### maltplotlib	-> make plots and figures
#### cv2		-> operation on images (read file, contour detection etc)
#### torch		-> neural network
#### time		-> mesure time passed during processing
#### skimage		-> some image manipulation
#### scipy		-> detect local maxima

## Part B : Nucleus detection

#### Required libraries for this part


## Part C : Centrioles-Nucleus association 

#### Required libraries for this part
